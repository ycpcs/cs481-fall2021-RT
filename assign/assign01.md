# Tasks

There are four tasks which are part of this assignment.

## Proposal

The first task is to distribute the students among the five teams designated in the syllabus, and designate yuor team leaders.  You have also been added to the previous team's Google Team Drive.  Also, you should create a contact information spreasheet in your new Google team drive, and establish your means for collaboration.  We will need to focus a good deal of attention on the Control Room application and the Radio Telescope simulation SW, while completing the remaining SW components.  We will finalize team assignments on the second week of class.  In addition, I will try to honor the requests for those of you who expressed interest in leading a team, as well as the overall project lead.  Again, we will determine this by the second week of class.

Your team should then write a 2-4 page report describing your chosen/assigned project(s).  In most cases, this work will be an extension of work that was performed by the previous SW Engineering team (2020-2021), and/or from the Engineering Capstone Radio Telescope team this past Summer.  You will be granted access to the **YCAS: Radio Telescope Project (2020-2021)** and **Summer 2021 Radio Telescope** Google Team Drives.  In order to properly define your team's work, you will need to research the state of the existing work, and discuss what needs to be refactored, modified, or added with your YCAS clients, as well as with the previous team leadership.

Your team report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your team (you may work on multiple teams)?
-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project (see the GitHub task below)?
-   What is the current state of the system that you will be working on?
-   What problem is solved by the system your team will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system, and WHY are you choosing them (what are their advantages over other possible choices)?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use drawings, block diagrams, wire frames, screen captures, as appropriate, to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Us!

You **must** meet with your YCAS clients (Todd and Kerry), and I **strongly recommend)** contacting the previous teams' leaders, to discuss project ideas, tasks, and priorities before you submit and present your formal project proposal.

## Set up a GitHub repository

Your second task is to create a main repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).  You will likely either be using and/or cloning from the previous team's repository.

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add the instructor (GitHub user [DonaldHakeII](https://github.com/DonaldHakeII).  At some point, you will likely also be adding Todd Ullery from YCAS, one or more team members from the current Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone team, as well as previous team members as technical advisors and/or contributors.

In the issue tracker for the main repository, create three labels:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per team member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your team may add additional labels as desired.

You will likely be cloning the existing GitHub repositories.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each team member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software they will need for the project.

You may use the physical space and computing equipment as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other teams, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.  The back of the KEC118 is reserved for the Radio Telescope project.

Please note that you are **NOT** required to use one of the provided lab PCs: you can use your own laptop, if you would prefer.  Given the uncertainty of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, I **highly** recommend that you work on your own laptops so that any transition to remote learning (if it comes) can be relatively seamless.

The procedures for setting up the development environments can be found on the previous team's Google Team Drive, which has alredy been shared with you.  The returning team members can help you with this.

## Interface with and run the Radio Telescope Hardware in the Porject Workspace

Your fourth tasks is to get the Radio Telescope mount up and running with the Control Room application in the Project Workspace, and train everyone how to use it. The Summer Engineering Capstone team left it in a working state, and gave a demo of operation at the end of the Summer.  Contact them if you need assistance.  We will be using a buddy system when working with the actual RT mount - you **MUST** have a partner when operating the RT mount.  We go over this in more detail on the first day of class, and you must demonstrate operation using the Control Room application during your proposal preentation.
