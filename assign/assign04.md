# Your Task

Your task is to create initial analysis and design models which identify the important classes in your system, and their relationships. You will ikely be building on an existing model from the previous team.  If so, indicate the changes/additions that you are making.  If your project includes a database, include the database schema showing the tables and fields of the database.  Use **textual analysis** from your Use Cases to identify the classes and attributes (nouns) and the methods and interfaces (verbs) for your UML diagram.

Your goal should be to create an initial UML design model that will provide a good framework to build upon.  Your initial design model will:

- Include all important core data model classes (the classes representing the most important concepts in the problem domain)
- Include *basic* user interface classes for the minimal working system
- Have sufficient methods to adequately describe the behaviors of each class
- Have an architecture which cleanly separates the data model classes from the user interface classes (MVC architecture)
- Follow design principles, such as the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle), OCP (Open-Closed Principle), and the Single Responsibility Principle.

Use [Violet UML](http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php), or some other UML modeling tool to create your model.

If your UML and/or OO modeling skills are rusty, **please see us**.  The ability to create a model of a system is hugely important, and potential employers are likely to ask OO modeling questions in job interviews.

# Grading


Your work will be graded as follows:

# Submitting

Post you model to your team's folder on the project's Google Drive in **PDF form**.  You should also post your source files for your model - but you also have to provide **a PDF version**.
